# Creating VendorBookings Component

Due to the large size of this component, I'll create it in a comprehensive but manageable way. The component needs:

1. Three tabs: All Bookings, Upcoming Bookings, Past Bookings
2. Upcoming bookings lifecycle display (Booking confirmed → Token received → Event pending)
3. Complete event functionality with photo upload
4. Payment and listing details display
5. Great UI/UX

The component will be created in the next step as a complete file.
